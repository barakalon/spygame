# Lesson 1

## Step 1 - Installation

Let's get set up with the basic tools you will need to develop the app.

### Version Control System (VCS) - git

We'll use a VCS to record the changes we make to our code. The most common one is called "git".

Git is not only important for tracking changes to our code - git is a very common way that developers share and collaborate on code. It's so common that tools like "Heroku" integrate with it, allowing us to deploy our code to actual servers using git commands. But don't worry about that yet.

Your computer likely already has git installed. To check, open the "Terminal" app, type "git", and hit enter. It might prompt you to install git - do it!

### Cloning the Repo

I've created a skeleton application to get the ball rolling. It doesn't do anything yet, but it should make it easier to get started writing code.

I wrote this skeleton application as code on my computer. I then used git to "push" my code to a shared git repository on Github. You can copy this code onto your machine using git.

In the Terminal app, change your directory to a place where you want this code to live. Here's what I recommend:

```
cd ~
mkdir Development
cd Development
```

Now, clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:barakalon/spygame.git
cd spygame
```

All of the code should now be on your computer.

And because we're using a git repository, you can push changes back up to Github. We can use this to collaborate on code, or to propose a change and have the other person provide feedback on the change. More on that later.

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - Sublime

We don't need anything fancy to write code - code is just text files. But some applications make writing code easier. These applications are called "IDE"s. At a very basic level, they can do things like syntax highlighting, which colors your code in a way that makes it easier to read. Fancier IDEs can autocomplete code, detect potential errors, integrate with git, and much, much more. But we don't need anything fancy for now. 

Let's use a popular, lightweight IDE: Sublime Text.

### Node

Node is a "Javascript runtime".

Wtf is that, you ask?

Remember, code is just text. It is instructions for a computer. People write code in a lower level language that knows how to interpret and run those instructions. 

We will be writing Javascript for both the frontend code that runs on peopel's browsers _and_ backend code that runs on our server.

In the case of the browser, applications like Chrome or Firefox know how to run your Javascript.

But what about the server? The server is like a simplified computer without a monitor or keyboard. It's probably running some simple Linux operating system. We need to install an application on that server that knows how to run our Javascript code. Node is that application.

But during development, we'll be running the server on our computer. So we also need node on our computer.

Anywho, install it:

### Node Package Manager (npm)

This is how we will install open source code written by other developers, so we don't have to start from scratch.

Npm comes installed with node, so let's go ahead and install the packages required by the skeleton app:

```
npm install
```

Voila. Good to go.


## Step 2 - Local Development

I've written a skeleton application that we can use to start developing.

There are so many different ways to write applications, and often the hardest part about getting started is simply choosing an option. I'm making this decision for you, just to get the ball rolling. I've chosen super simple frameworks so that we can focus on the fundamentals - no need to worry about using the hippest Javascript framework just yet. 

For the frontend code, we're going to use `handlebars` to render HTML.

For the backed code, we're going to use the `express` framework.

### Run the server

Before we look at the code - let's see what we already have with the skeleton.

To start our server running on our computer, type this command into the terminal (making sure we're still in the `spygame` directory):

```
npm run debug
```

You should see something like this printed out:

```
spygame:server Listening on port 3000 +0ms
```

Now, open up a web browser and type "localhost:3000" into the URL. You should see our app!


### Directory structure

Let's give a brief overview of all the code we have in this skeleton.

Open up the `spygame` directory in Sublime Text.

_Don't be frightened by all the different files. A lot of it is "boilerplate", automatically generated by following the directions [here](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html)._

```
spygame/
  bin/
  node_modules/
  public/
  routes/
  views/
```

**bin**

This is short for "binaries", and its where we will put commands that we can run from the Terminal. 

Right now the only command there is "www", and this is what starts our backend server. Feel free to open up that file and look through it, but don't worry too much about what it includes - we won't spend much time editing that file.

**node_modules**

This is where the "Node Package Manager" installs all the modules written by other developers. Note that this file is greyed out in Sublime Text - this is because sublime recognize that this folder is in the ".gitignore" file, which tells git to ignore this directory when tracking changes. This is why we had to run `npm install`, because these files weren't included when we ran `git clone`.

**public**

This is where we can put "static" content that will be served to the frontend. "Static" content means that it doesn't change - no matter which client requests it, its always stays the same. We'll put things like pictures and CSS stylesheets here.

It's easier to understand "static" content if we compare it to "dynamic" content, which is what the "views" are.

**routes**

This is where most of our "backend" code lives. 

If you open up `index.js`, you'll see a small file:

```
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index');
});

module.exports = router;
```

The first line, `var express = require('express');`, is where we import the "express" package. We assign the package to the name "express", and we can then call functions that the package provides using that name.

The second line, `var router = express.Router();`, is where we "instantiate" an Express router. Without worrying too much about the details - a router allows us to route incoming requests to different functions. 

Next we'll see how we do this routing:

```
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index');
});
```

Again, without worrying too much about Javascript syntax, this says that if a client requests the URL "/", we should respond by rendering the "index" view.

And lastly, `module.exports = router;` - this allows other Javascript files to import the router we've just created.

**views**

This is where we define the HTML files that the browser will display.

But these are HTML files on steroids. We're using a "templating" package called "Handlebars". 

Handlebars let's us break our HTML files into many smaller files, making our code much easier to manage. Notice how the `layout.hbs` template has a `{{{body}}}` tag - we can now use this layout file on all of our pages. More on this another time.


It also let's the server dynamically render text _into_ the HTML files. Again - more on this another time.


### Make a change to the frontend

Open up `index.hbs`.

You'll see some HTML, which I believe you're already familiar with.

Make any change here - for example, add a paragraph at the bottom:

```
<p>Barak is the best!</p>
```

Save the file, go back to the browser, and reload the page. You should see your changes!
